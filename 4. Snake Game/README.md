# snake-game

We have an old-school addiction to the snake game on earlier Nokia phones. But, of course, we no longer have it. What if you could create one in Python for yourself? Beginner Python programmers who want to make anything simpler in their area should absolutely attempt this, and the Turtle module was developed expressly for beginners to try and submit as part of the project. Python 3 will be used to complete the project.
